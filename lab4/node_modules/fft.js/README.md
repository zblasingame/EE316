# FFT.js
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/indutny/fft.js.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/indutny/fft.js)
[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/fft.js.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/fft.js)

Implementation of Radix-4 FFT.

## Usage

```js
const FFT = require('fft.js');

const f = new FFT(4096);

const input = new Array(4096);
input.fill(0);

const out = f.createComplexArray();
```

If `data` has just real numbers as is the case when `toComplexArray` is
used - real FFT may be run to compute it 25% faster:
```js
const realInput = new Array(f.size);
f.realTransform(out, realInput);
```

`realTransform` fills just the left half of the `out`, so if the full
spectrum is needed (which is symmetric):
```js
f.completeSpectrum(out);
```

If `data` on other hand is a complex array:
```js
const data = f.toComplexArray(input);
f.transform(out, data);
```

Inverse fourier transform:
```js
f.inverseTransform(data, out);
```
